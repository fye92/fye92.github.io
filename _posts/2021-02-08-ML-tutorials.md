Here is a series of machine learning tutorial I created on Kaggle.com. These tutorials come with both explanation in text and live examples that you can run.

1. Regression and Gradient Descent: https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-1-regression-gradient-descent

2. Regularized Linear Models and Early Stopping: https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-2-regularized-lm-early-stopping

3. Logistic and Softmax Regression: https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-3-logistic-and-softmax-regression

4. Support Vector Machine: https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-4-support-vector-machine

5. Random Forests: https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-5-random-forests

6. Ensemble Learning: https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-6-basic-ensemble-learning

7. Boosting: https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-7-boosting
