My research focuses on establishing whole-brain functional networks from
neuroimaging data (e.g. functional MRI, PET) and studying the structures of these networks.
Here are a few examples of what I have been doing:

  - **Multi-task co-activation patterns of young adolescents.**
    Multi-task co-activation patterns obtained from task-based functional MRI can reveal robust functional networks of the brain.
    Here, I am looking at these co-activation patterns in young adolescents and how they are related to risk of developing addictions. I am also studying how these patterns change with age.

  - **Metabolic networks of Alzheimer's disease.**
    Changes in the structure of whole-brain functional networks can be an indicator of diseases. In this project, I constructed
    brain metabolic networks from FDG-PET data and compared their structures between controls and Alzheimer's disease patients.
    
  - **Resting-state connectivity of healthy young adults.**
    Resting-state connectivity networks can be constructed from resting-state function MRI (rs-fMRI) data. The structure of this network
    is different between individuals and between different time points. I studied how the modular structure of these resting-state networks correlate with
    performances of a few cognitive tasks in healthy young adults.
