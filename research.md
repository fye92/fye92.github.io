    description: Resting-state connectivity networks can be constructed from resting-state function MRI (rs-fMRI) data. The structure of this network
    is different between individuals and between different time points. I studied how the modular structure of these resting-state networks correlate with
    performances of a few cognitive tasks in healthy young adults and found that task complexity mediates this relationship.

My research focuses on establishing whole-brain functional networks from
neuroimaging data (e.g. functional MRI, PET) and studying the structures of these networks.
Here are a few examples of what I have been doing:
